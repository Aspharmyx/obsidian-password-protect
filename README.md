# Obsidian Password Plugin

With this plugin you can set password to different notes and folders.

The hidden notes will be visible only after you enter the password on each session.

The pages can be seen after the plugin is disabled or from the file explorer. It's not %100 safe or encrypted but it can be protective against casual viewers.
